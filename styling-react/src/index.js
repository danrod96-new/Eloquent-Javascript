/* The first and most simple is to use classes, and use a normal CSS file to target those classes */

/* This is interesting,
 * A second method is to use the style attribute attached to a JSX element. Using this 
 * approach you don't need a separate CSS file. */

/* CSS is defined in a slightly different way now. First, notice the double curly brackets: itâ€™s because 
 * style accepts an object (YES, THAT'S A OBJECT !!!). We pass in a JavaScript object, which is defined in curly braces. */

/* Also, the style now is camelCased instead of using dashes. Every time a CSS property has a dash, remove it and start the next word capitalized. */
